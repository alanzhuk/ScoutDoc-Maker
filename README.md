In high school, I did policy debate for 4 years to help my critical thinking, note-taking, and public speaking skills. One of the most essential elements of policy debate is the preparation that happens before tournaments; teams spend months before tournaments preparing for certain teams. One of the ways teams knew how to prepare was to check a website where everyone in the country disclosed their arguments. I made a webscraping application which was able to compile this information.

How To Use It

To use the application, you just go to the page for the debate tournament you are attending. Tournament pages all have a button that spits out a CSV file with all the entries at the tournament. You can then put that CSV file into the algorithm, specify a file path for the ScoutDoc and then press run and it will spit out another CSV with the scoutdoc.
